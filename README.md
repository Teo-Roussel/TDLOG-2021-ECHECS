TDLOG Repository - Project by Antonin Boisneault, Hamza Zerhouni, Robin Boezennec and Teo Roussel

This repository contains everything you need in order to play our application. 
If you are under Windows, please download our Application Installer which you can download by clicking on the link inside the folder named Application.
Sadly we did not produce an application that works under MAC-OS or Linux. 

Therefore, you're free to download all our codes in order to use it through python 3.7 and over. For that please download the folder Projects_Code.zip
Once it is done and you've extracted the files in your favorite repository, please open a terminal that is linked to your python environment. Then go into the Install-Module-Pybind folder then turn-on your internet connexion and write :
```
python setup.py install
```
ATTENTION : To do so you need to have Visual Studio installed with both Python et C++ extensions.
Please wait until it is finished then you can go into your favorite python IDE and try to write :
```
import moduleAI
```
If that works please continue; otherwise contact antonin.boisneault@eleves.enpc.fr

Once it works, you can freely use our programm with lauching our Initial_Window.py file as script (Please be careful. It is necessary to run it as script. In Pyzo, please do Run file as script or Ctrl+Shift+E. If you're a PyCharm User, you probably already know how to do it)

To fully enjoy our game, please enter the mode you want to play then your name(s) and color if AI mode. Then please if it's your first time click on the Game menu (situating in the menu bar of the playing window that has appeared) then on Rules and functionalities. It is a must to enjoy our game to the fullest with all its functionnalities

Good luck and have fun !

Respectfully, 

The Team
